.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/bccp/abopt.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/bccp/abopt

The package contains two components:

- optimize:
  L-BFGS and Conjugate-Gradient optimizer, translated from Cosmo++.

- model: 
  vmad (Virtual Machine Automated Differentiation),
  a differentiable state machine for forward modelling.
